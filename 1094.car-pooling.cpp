 * Testcase Example:  '[[2,1,5],[3,3,7]]\n4'
 *
 * There is a car with capacity empty seats. The vehicle only drives east
 * (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).
 * 
 * You are given the integer capacity and an array trips where trips[i] =
 * [numPassengersi, fromi, toi] indicates that the i^th trip has numPassengersi
 * passengers and the locations to pick them up and drop them off are fromi and
 * toi respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due
 * east from the car's initial location.
 * 
 * Return true if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all
 * the given trips, or false otherwise.
 * 
 * 
 * Example 1:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 4
 * Output: false
 * 
 * 
 * Example 2:
 * 
 * 
 * Input: trips = [[2,1,5],[3,3,7]], capacity = 5
 * Output: true
 * 
 * 
 * 
 * Constraints:
 * 
 * 
 * 1 <= trips.length <= 1000
 * trips[i].length == 3
 * 1 <= numPassengersi <= 100
 * 0 <= fromi < toi <= 1000
 * 1 <= capacity <= 10^5
